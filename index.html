  <h2>About me:</h2>
<p>I think of myself as a human bridge.<label for="mn-bridge" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-bridge" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">Unlike the Takoma Narrows Bridge, I prefer a damping ratio greater than zero.</span> I live in the domain between academia and secondary school, theory and practice, abstract and concrete, physical and mental. I am
privileged to teach highly capable students and honored to help them solve real problems. My educational philosophy is to encourage critical problem solving,
not just procedural fluency, to prepare them for the day they encounter the problem that nobody yet knows will exist. I believe in robust systems to support
individual discretion and advocate for excellence regardless of domain. </p>

    <h2>Things I teach:</h2>

    
<p>I teach in the context of a competitive, criteria-based STEM magnet program with a cohort format. In all of my classes, I strive to create a low-floor, high-ceiling environment that is inquiry driven and has meaningful, doable tasks for students that centers the cognitive load on them, rather than me. I welcome collaboration and constructive
criticism. I am happy to share and also gladly accept materials related to my content.</p>
<p>For underclassmen, I cover the fundamental concepts of computer science: imperative and functional programming, 
computer applications, systems dynamics modeling, number systems, Boolean algebra, digital logic, bit string flicking,<label for="mn-flick" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-flick" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">The goal isn't the bits or the flicking; it's the precise thinking.</span> and 
essentials of computer architecture.</p>

<p>For upperclassmen, my course assignments vary, but I generally teach three courses: Discrete Mathematics (combinatorics, graph theory,<label for="mn-logo" class="margin-toggle"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-logo" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote"><img src="bridge_logo_light.svg" alt="Bridge logo" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></span> logic, 
and sequences), Artificial Intelligence (search algorithms, game playing, rule-based systems, machine learning, neural 
networks, and emerging ethical issues), and Analysis of Algorithms (Big O notation, linked 
lists, stacks and queues, heaps, priority queues, binary search trees, searching and sorting algorithms, 
and recursion).</p>

    <h2>My other interests:</h2>
    <p>I am an active paramedic in a suburban 911 system that aligns with my goals of evidence-based, compassionate practice: I work year-round as a volunteer and seasonally as employment. I enjoy providing high levels of prehospital care and am committed to remaining current in the field of paramedicine.<label for="mn-evidence" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-evidence" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">Evidence <em>does</em> have its limits. For example, no peer reviewed double blind study exists to validate the use of a parachute while skydiving.</span> I have also earned a black belt in the art
    of Tang Soo Do and continue to practice regularly. To me, Computer Science, Paramedicine, and Martial Arts are not disparate: cultivation of mind, body, and spirit, are all aspects of the whole self. </p>
